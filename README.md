# WP_Plugin_Skeleton
A skeleton for an OOP wordpress plugin. Based on the architecture and logic of the [Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/devinvinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate/), but remade and adapted to suit my personal preferences and sensibilities.

## usage
1. Find-Replace all instances of SKELETON with the name of your plugin, including file names. All these uses will be in strings or comments, so they should be safe.
2. Find-Replace all instance of SKEL with the namespace of your plugin.
